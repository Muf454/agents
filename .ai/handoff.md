# Handoff

## What has been implemented?
Toolkit self-installed. Plan for batch 1 (T001–T009) from the vault backlog.
- T001: permissions template allows read-only shell (ls/grep/cat/head/tail/wc/echo),
  git rm/mv and `.ai/bin/ai-task`; sed/rg/find deliberately excluded; README documents
  that these can read files outside the project. Test fixture no longer inherits
  `AI_PIPELINE`/`AI_LOCK_HELD` (they broke 4 tests when the gate ran inside a pipeline).

## Validation
`.ai/validate`: shell syntax + full test suite.

## Manual testing for the human
1. Read the PR's summary of each item; the tests cover behaviour (mocked agents).
2. After merging: `setup-project --upgrade ~/Projects/raid-planner` shows a sensible preview.
3. Permissions: in a project set up from this toolkit, `.ai/permissions.allow` lists
   `Bash(cat *)`, `Bash(git rm *)`, `Bash(.ai/bin/ai-task *)` etc., and contains no
   sed/rg/find/curl entry. In an unattended run, `cat README.md` works but
   `cat README.md > x` and `ls; curl …` are denied.

## Human todos
None.

## Next action
Runner continues with T002 (shared tool contract and ai-task).
